### Welcome!

I'm Max, a generalist problem solver who loves contributing to vibrant teams!

Prior to nDreams, I built Otter (https://otter-framework.dev) with a remote team of four spread across North America. Otter is an open-source, cloud native framework that allows developers to easily integrate peer-to-peer video communication within their own web application. By combining WebRTC and AWS serverless technology, Otter provides private 1-on-1 virtual meetings at scale with a single API call.

Prior to Otter, I worked three years as an actuarial associate in the insurance industry before transitioning to a career as a software engineer. Actuarial science relies on mathematics, statistics, and finance to quantify risk present in insurance products. I held the Associate of the Casualty Actuarial Society (ACAS) title and had one exam left in order to obtain my Fellow of the Casualty Actuarial Society (FCAS) title. I decided not to write the last exam as a career change into the tech industry would have made it rather expensive and tedious to maintain this credential.

Apart from that, I love to practice Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu!
