I'm a backend software developer who loves contributing to vibrant teams!

I recently built Otter (otter-framework.dev) with a remote team of four spread across North America.
Otter is an open-source cloud native framework to easily integrate peer-to-peer communication within web applications.
It relies on WebRTC and AWS serverless technology to provide 1-on-1 private meetings at scale with a single API call.

Apart from coding and reading web engineering books, I love to practice Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu!

You can learn more about me on my personal website maxamoretti.com!
