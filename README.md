### Welcome!

I'm Max, a generalist problem solver who loves contributing to vibrant teams! I currently work as an Infrastructure Engineer at nDreams Orbital Studio where we are developing live social VR games that players will love for years!

I built Otter (https://otter-framework.dev) with a remote team of four spread across North America. Otter is an open-source, cloud native framework that allows developers to easily integrate peer-to-peer video communication within their own web application. By combining WebRTC and AWS serverless technology, Otter provides private 1-on-1 virtual meetings at scale with a single API call.

Apart from that, I love to practice Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu!
