### Welcome!

I'm Max, an Infrastructure Engineer who loves contributing to vibrant teams!

I recently built Otter (https://otter-framework.dev) with a remote team of four spread across North America.
Otter is an open-source, cloud native framework that enables peer-to-peer video communication within web applications.
By combining WebRTC and AWS serverless technology, Otter provides private 1-on-1 virtual meetings at scale with a single API call.

Apart from that, I love to practice Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu!
